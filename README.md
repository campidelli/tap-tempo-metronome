# tap-tempo-metronome
An Arduino/ESP32 tap tempo metronome.

The idea is to make a click sound pedal so it can be used for a whole band to play on the same tempo using in-ear monitors.

# TO DO
- The tempo drifts a little after a while when I compare it to another metronome that has a tap tempo feature.
